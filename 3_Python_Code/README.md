Image to Binary Conversion Script

This Python script converts an input RGB image into raw binary data for FPGA processing. The image is resized to a fixed resolution and converted into a NumPy array, which is then flattened and written as a binary file. This binary output serves as the input stimulus for the RC6 Verilog encryption testbench, enabling file-based verification of the FPGA design.

Key Purpose:

Preprocess image data for HDL simulation

Bridge software image data and FPGA RTL input

Binary to Image Reconstruction Script

This Python script reconstructs an image from decrypted binary data generated by the FPGA simulation. It reads the binary file, reshapes the data into the original image dimensions, and converts it back into an image format. This allows visual verification of the RC6 decryption output by comparing the reconstructed image with the original input image.

Key Purpose:

Postprocess FPGA output data

Validate encryption–decryption correctness visually
