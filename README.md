# RC6 Image Encryption and Decryption

RC6-based image encryption and decryption system designed for secure image transmission and cryptographic analysis.  
The project implements the RC6 symmetric block cipher for encrypting image data and reconstructing the original image through decryption.

This work demonstrates cryptographic algorithm implementation, bit-level data processing, and hardware-oriented design concepts relevant to embedded systems and digital design.

## 🔐 Overview

Digital images contain sensitive information and require secure storage and transmission.  
This project applies the RC6 encryption algorithm to image data by converting pixel values into binary form, encrypting them using key-dependent transformations, and reconstructing the original image through decryption.

The implementation combines:

- Python → image preprocessing and binary conversion  
- Verilog → RC6 encryption/decryption logic  
- Simulation → functional verification
